The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors or tones generated by the game. It consists of four colored buttons - red, blue, green, and yellow. The game starts by displaying a sequence of colors in a specific order, and the player must replicate that sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more complex, testing the player's memory and attention span.

## Additional Information

This Simon Game project is part of the Boss Level Challenge 2 in "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" instructed by Angela Yu. The provided starting files include an `index.html` file styled with CSS for buttons and a `sounds` folder containing UI sounds for the buttons.

The challenge involves step-by-step instructions to build the game's functionality using JavaScript, jQuery, and other web development techniques. Each step guides you through implementing different aspects of the game, such as generating patterns, displaying sequences, handling user clicks, adding sounds, and more.
